### 1. Write for your audience

Make sure your report or exported data will be useful for your audience
 </br>
Know your audience's baseline understanding of the subject matter and statistical
methods


All data manipulation, statistical methodology, results, etc should be clear 
without reading the code. Include formulas in the text when appropriate.

### 2. Organize your document and each section

Structure the document in a way that will make the most sense to the reader
</br>
Fully contain each step of the process into one section and use subsections 
to organize the code (aviod distributing the steps of an analysis to different
sections throughout the document)
</br>
Start with the most general dataset with crude analyses before 
subsetted or stratified analyses


### 3. Prepare the data early

**Data preparation includes creating new columns, manipulating data, and formatting,
corrections to spelling, dates, and formatting** Document all changes to the 
underlying data in a dedicated section before any analyses.

</br>
Define, create, and describe all new and manipulated dataset columns before 
starting the analysis

### 4. Follow standard naming conventions

Predictable naming helps streamline writing and reviewing code
* *column names* should be lower snake case in utf-8 format without any special
characters or acccents (ex: Use;  `Unité âge (mois, années)` )

### 5. Show uncertainty

Confidence intervals should be used: 

1. to represet the uncertainty around generalisability from sample to population
2. to represent uncertainty and variable conditions in data collection
3. predictions and imputations



```{}

 -------------------------    |Yes|----- **Include Confidence Interval**
|                         |     |  
|     Might the value     |     |
| observed be different   |-----|
| with a larger sample?   |     |                 |Yes|--| **CI not required**
|                         |     |    -----------   |
 -------------------------    |No|--| You sure? |--|
                                     -----------   |
                                                  |No|-- **Ask a statistician!**
```



```{r eval = TRUE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width = 4, fig.pos = "center"}
ebola_sim <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "outbreaks_ebola_sim_list.rds"))
date_onset <- ebola_sim$linelist$date_of_onset

i.7 <- incidence(date_onset, interval = "1 week")
fit.both <- fit(i.7, split=as.Date("2014-10-15"))
plot(i.7, fit=fit.both)

print(fit.both)

```

### 6. Code systematically

Be consistent in functions in libraries used

* *use `linelist::clean_data`* with a data dictionary for cleaning dates,
column names and values, etc. Take the time to understand how to use this 
package and how it works.

* for example choose between `n()`, `tally()`, and `count()` when summarizing 
grouped data


### 7. Always use relative paths

Absolute paths will not work when the code is run on other computers. Use the
`here` library with R project files to establish a root directory

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Use:
read.csv(here::here("/data/file_name.csv")

# NOT:
read.csv("P://user/specific/path/to/shared/directory/data/file_name.csv")

```

### 8. Version and archive documents

Use semantic versioning in a clearly organized, standardized file structure

```
.
+-- linelist_investigations
|   +-- css
|   +-- data
|   +-- report_outputs
|   +-- report_sources
|       +-- aaa_clean_linelist_2019-29-09.Rmd
|       +-- epicurve_2019-04-10.Rmd
|       +-- _archive
|           +-- epicurve_2019-23-09.Rmd
|           +-- epicurve_2019-12-09.Rmd

```

### 9. Use descriptive naming

Variables, functions, and data sets should be named in a way that describes the 
object

### 10. Prepare presentation-ready plots

**Plots should be ready to copy and paste into an official presentation**

* check labels for correct spelling, accents, and grammar 
* uniform colors for variables throughout a document
* text size large
* avoid overlapping labels or other features



### 11. Always have your code reviewed

Ensure that:

* Analysis is appropriate to setting and underlying data is well understood, 
local collaborators should be included and acknowledged
* statistical methodology is applied correctly
* R code is readable and correctly implements methodology 
* markdown and the report document are well organized and properly formatted

### 12. Keep data safe

Respect the privacy of the individuals described in the data

Never label data as anonomysed without complying with best practices of the
standards and methods of anonymyzation (and clear final product with a 
qualified statistician)


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
